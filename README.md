## Description
    
This application is an image gallery specifically a Illustration portfolio for myself. Using react with cloudinary and flexbox I wanted to build a single page application that took the headache out of adding new images to my portfolio. Now I can simply add an illustration file to cloudinary and it will be added to the front of my gallery making sure my most recent art is always at the top.

## installation
    
If you would like to try using the application for yourself simply clone the repo and replace the cloudinary api call on app.js with either your own or another DB to gather images from. You will also need to update your routes in the Image component as well.
    
## Usage

[Depoyed site](https://sean-morgan-illustration.herokuapp.com/)
    
Simply by adding new images to my cloudinary account with the tag illustration and an alt tag images will be added to the top of my portfolio. Flexbox will make sure the page flows propperly and each image thumbnail will never be windowed as to not show the full image. Also a light box feature has been added to the whole gallery so each image can be viewed in full size.
